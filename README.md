# foodlist

Flask application to store and create weekly food lists

Ideas:

Login and Sharing functionality is a must, lists should therefore have a unique url

1. A rolling weekly food list which you can add and edit foods to/from
2. Another page where you can add, edit and remove foods which you have in your rotation - and these can autocomplete or even be suggested randomly when modifying the food list itself


Possible enhancements:

Choose how many meals you want to have per day?
Categorizing food
Predicting or suggesting foods you have not eaten for a while?
